# Vanilla Essentials
This plugin for Bukkit started out as a way to enforce "vanilla" (no _add ons_, plain old regular original) gameplay in Minecraft. _Ironic isn't it._

Eventually, I saw a need for some fun and hierarchization.

**Features include:**

* Gods, goddess, and elders

* "Terrorist protection" - players that can't break glass for some reason :)

* A rapid firing arrow gun

* Secure players (they have to type in an extra password)

* A world edit like command that builds big ugly structures that "lag" the server and may crash it :)

Bukkit version: bukkit-1.7.9-R0.1

Java version: 6 (1.6)
