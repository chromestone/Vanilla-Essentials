This plugin for Bukkit started out as a way to enforce "Vanilla" (no add ons, plain old regular original) gameplay in Minecraft, ironicaly.

Eventually, I saw a need for some fun and hierarchization.

features include:

gods, goddess, and elders

"terrorist" players that can't break glass for some reason :)

a rapid firing arrow gun

secure players (they have to type in an extra password)

a world edit like command that builds big ugly structures that lag the server and may crash it :)

Bukkit version: bukkit-1.7.9-R0.1

Java version: 6 (1.6)
